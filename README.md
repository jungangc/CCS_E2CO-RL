# CCS_E2CO-RL

Code for 
["Optimization of pressure management strategies for geological CO2 storage using surrogate model-based reinforcement learning"]((https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1750583624002056)).

under construction

step 1: run MSE2C_Ksteps.ipynb to construct E2CO proxy models (either one should work, maybe MSE2C_Ksteps_SC.ipynb work best)


step 2: run RL_SAC_train.ipynb to employ RL to optimize
